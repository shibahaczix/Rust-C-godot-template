How to setup:<br />
note: you need to have basic knowlage of scons c++ rust and godot<br />
download nix<br />
run nix-shell<br />
modify main Sconstruct file, gdexample and demo directory to have your customized names<br />
and modify in src register_types and gdexamples be also your custom names
then run ./build.sh or do everything manually<br />
and you should have everything<br />

also i do not recommend using c++ and rust together it would introduce a lot of complexities if youre working with a team
